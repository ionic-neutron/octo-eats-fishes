Its a Dx-Ball (break out) game developed using Phaser (A open source HTML5 game Framework). 
The game has all the essential functionality.


I have used "Bracket" editor to develop the game and the Phaser version is 2.1.2. To run this game in your browser you need to setup a local serve like wamp,xampp or you can simply Download the Bracket.io and copy the project in the editor and open in "live preview".

The project is tranformed into bitbucket here is the link https://shohan4556@bitbucket.org/ionic_neutron/octo-needs-fishes.git
